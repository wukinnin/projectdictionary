# Project Dictionary

README shamelessly generated by ChatGPT

I need your guidance for this project im building. I am creating a python program for a *word dictionary.* 
Here's the kicker:
The program itself is in python.
It contains an interactive menu in CLI.
You should know that the words themselves are stored in the data type dictionary.

Here's the simplified roadmap:

### **1. Define the Project**
   - **Goal**: Build a Python program that acts as a word dictionary with options to add, delete, edit, display, and search words, depending on their part of speech.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Command-line interface (CLI) with a menu for interaction.
     - Store words based on part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, adverb).
     - Input validation and error handling.

### **2. Design the Program Structure**
   - **Data Storage**: Use a dictionary to store words, with each word having properties like meaning, part of speech, and specific forms (e.g., tenses, singular/plural).
     - Example: 
       ```python
       word_dict = {
           "brave": {
               "meaning": "showing courage",
               "part_of_speech": "adjective",
               "comparative": "braver",
               "superlative": "bravest",
               "examples": {...}
           }
       }
       ```

   - **CLI Menu**:
     - Create a simple menu for users to interact with:
       ```plaintext
       1. Add Word
       2. Delete Word
       3. Edit Word
       4. Display Words
       5. Search Word
       Enter your choice:
       ```
### **3. Develop Core Functions**
   - **Step 1**: Implement the `add_word()` function.
     - Collect the word, meaning, part of speech, and extra details depending on the part of speech.
     - Store everything in the dictionary.

   - **Step 2**: Implement the `delete_word()` function.
     - Ask for the word and remove it from the dictionary if it exists.

   - **Step 3**: Implement the `edit_word()` function.
     - Allow the user to modify the meaning, part of speech, or other properties of a word.

   - **Step 4**: Implement the `display_words()` function.
     - Show all words in the dictionary, sorted in ascending or descending order.

   - **Step 5**: Implement the `search_word()` function.
     - Allow the user to search for a specific word and display its details.

### **4. Add Input Validation**
   - Ensure the program handles invalid inputs smoothly:
     - Check if the word already exists before adding.
     - Validate the part of speech entered by the user.
     - Handle empty inputs or invalid data.
     - 
### **5. Test Each Function**
   - **Test Adding Words**: Add multiple words of different parts of speech.
   - **Test Deleting Words**: Try deleting words and confirm theyâ€™re removed.
   - **Test Editing Words**: Edit existing words and ensure changes are applied.
   - **Test Display and Search**: Display and search for words, checking the output.

### **6. Optional Enhancements**
   - **Save to File**: Allow the program to save the dictionary to a file (e.g., JSON) so the data persists after closing the program.
   - **Load from File**: Load the dictionary from a file when the program starts.

### **7. Finalize**
   - **Refine the CLI**: Make sure the menu is clear and easy to navigate.
   - **Error Handling**: Ensure that invalid inputs or actions are handled gracefully (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent word).
   - **Polish the Output**: Format the displayed words in a clean and readable way.
